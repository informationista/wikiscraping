On top of 2016 being a bit of a dumpster fire of a year in general,
doesn't it seem like a lot of famous people have died in 2016? I set out
to find out if that's true or just my perception. (Also I needed to
learn how to use the Rvest package for another project and while I was
waiting for the details on that project, I decided to use this as an
experiment to play around with it.)

I'm still finalizing the analysis, but, spoiler alert: no, it doesn't
not appear that more famous people died this year than other years.
